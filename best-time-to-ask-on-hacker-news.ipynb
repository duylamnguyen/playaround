    "2. Why is time between 13:00 and 15:00 the best?\n",

    "- It's kind to help other people.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the last question, I found a similar question in [Stackoverflow blog](https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/01/06/the-best-time-to-ask-a-stack-overflow-question/). It happens that most popular time to post is between 15:00 and 22:00. In my opion, in the morning, people is busy at work, so they won't have time. Right after lunch, some people would like to take a nap, and they could still be sleepy at the begining of afternoon; or many tasks haven't done yet. But from 15:00, our day is nearly finish, it makes us feel more relax and we could do something else such as answer a question on Hacker News."
